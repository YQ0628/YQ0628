### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is ä¹”äºˆYu Qiao
I know it may be hard for you to pronounce my name -- I heard so many English speakers pronounce "Yu" as "You" but it is not correct! So here are some little tips: you tongue needs to stay tense like it is when you make the "Yi" sound (or the English "ee" sound), but you lips must be rounded in the end!

I was born and grow up in Guangzhou (historically known as Canton), China. As a Cantonese, I'm always proud of Cantonese cuisines such as dim sum! Let's be friends and I'll show you the best dim sum places in NYC!:wink:

I'm a first year MPA student at SIPA concentrating on EPD, and specializing in DAQA and GPP. Although I have no idea about my future path currently, I want to navigate more gender-related social problems and advocate for gender equality.  

In my free time, I like gaming! Recently, I'm obsessed with Splatoon 3, a game on Nintendo Switch (though I'm really bad at it). Let's team up and play together if you're also playing it!ðŸ¥°
